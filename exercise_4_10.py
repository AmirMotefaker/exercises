# 10. Write a program that takes a number from the user. Then show the following modes to the user:
# Note that in the end only one of the following messages should be displayed to the user.
#           Result                                         condition
# If the number was divisible by 3,                 say it is divisible by 3
# If the number was divisible by 5,                 say it is divisible by 5
# If the number was divisible by both 3 and 5,      say it is divisible by 15
# If it is not divisible by any of them,            say it is not divisible by any of them

# num = int(input("Enter number :"))

# if (num % 3 == 0) and (num % 5 == 0):
#     print("The number is divisible by 3,5.")
# elif num % 3 == 0:
#     print("The number is divisible by 3.")
# elif num % 5 == 0:
#     print("The number is divisible by 5.")


# else:
#     print("It is not divisible on any of them.")

# output:
# Enter number :15
# The number is divisible by 3,5.

# output:
# Enter number :21
# The number is divisible by 3.


# Solution 2 - CodingYar
input_num = int(input('Enter your number: '))

if input_num % 15 == 0:
    print('#15')
elif input_num % 3 == 0:
    print('#3')
elif input_num % 5 == 0:
    print('#5')
else:
    print('No')

# output:
# Enter your number: 27
# 3

# output:
# Enter your number: 30
# 15

# output:
# Enter your number: 25
# 5
