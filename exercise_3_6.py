# 6. Write the above program using variables.
# Save the result of each operation in a separate variable.
# Then save the final result in another variable and print it.

a = 2 ** 10
b = 15 +(-3)
c = 3 * 1000

print((a * b + c))

# output
# 15288


z = 2
x = 3
y = 10
p = 15
q = 1000

a = z ** y
b = p -x
c = a * b
d = x * q
result = c + d

print(result)

# output
# 15288
