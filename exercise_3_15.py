# 15. Save the values of both previous questions in two separate variables. 
# Then multiply the variable that has the answer to the previous question 
# by 3 and add the result to the variable that has the answer to the previous two questions.


a = (100 % 3)
b = (100 // 3)

c = (b * 3) + a

print(c)
# Output 
# 100


exercise13 = 100 % 3
exercise14 = 100 // 3

print(exercise14 * 3 + exercise13)
# Output 
# 100
