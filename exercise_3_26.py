# 26. Make a list that includes the numbers 5, 9, 14, 12, 10, -1, -4, and 9, respectively.
# - Without using Python, just looking at the list you created, how long do you think this list is?
# - Get the length of this list using Python.
# - Without using Python, just looking at the list, what do you think is the last index of this list?
# - Check the above by writing the Python code.

my_list = ['5', '9', '14', '12', '10', '-1', '-4', '9']

print(len(my_list))
# len = 8
# last index = 7


print(my_list[-1])
# output
# 8
# 9

print(my_list[7])
# output
# 9
