# 3. Write a mathematical phrase that uses the operations
# of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power.
# (The purpose of this exercise is to simply review these items)

# a = 1
# b = 2

# print(a + b) 
# print(a - b)
# print(a * b)
# print(a / b)
# print(a ** b)

print((5 + ((2 - 3) * 2 / 4 ) ** 2 ))
# output 
# 5.25


print( ((2 + 3) ** 2) - 10 * 30 / 40)
# output
# 17.5

# +- */ ** 
# The first priority is with power,
# then with multiplication and division,
# and then with addition and subtraction
